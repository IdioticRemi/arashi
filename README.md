## How to install:

#### Prerequisites: latest node.js version.

1. Clone the branch you want into a folder on your PC using git or the downloadable .zip file.
2. Install the dependencies:
```node
npm install
```
3. Change the name of the file `"public-config.js"` to be `"config.js"`.
4. Put your bot token in file `config.js`. (the one you just changed the name)
5. Execute the bot using: 
```node
node arashi.js
```
